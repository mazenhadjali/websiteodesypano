        "contenue creation 1":"The North West region of Tunisia consists of a vast mountainous and forest area crossed by the most important rivers of the country and with significant natural potential but its socio-economic conditions remain difficult. Unlike other regions, the North West is home to almost all dams and reservoirs (water tower of Tunisia) serving the majority of Tunisian populations. The mountainous and forested areas of the North-West, which are part of this large region, were particularly seriously affected by the small size and highly fragmented holdings. High pressure on land resources and rangelands results in forest clearing, overexploitation of pastures and soil erosion. Population isolation is also a major problem. The lack of drinking water is also a constraint for these populations. The unemployment rate exceeds the national average, favouring the migration of young people to large urban areas.",
        "contenue creation 2":"It is within the framework of the political will of the Tunisian government to conserve water and soil resources and promote the sustained development of these areas (mountainous areas of the four North-West governorates: Beja, Jendouba, Kef, Siliana and Bizerte governorate), which it was decided to create in 1981, the Office of Sylvo-Pastoral Development of the North-West (ODESYPANO) by law 81-17 of 09 March 1981.",
        "contenue creation 3":"ODESYPANO is a public non-administrative institution (EPNA) with civil personality and financial autonomy, under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries."
